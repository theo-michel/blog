      <p>
        The best part is no part. The best process is no process. It weighs
        nothing, costs nothing, can't go wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        We spend so much time adding. Features, options, configurations. Each
        addition feels like progress. But complexity compounds. Every new
        element interacts with every other element.
      </p>

      <p>
        Simplicity isn't the absence of sophistication. It's the result of it.
        You have to understand something deeply before you can express it
        simply.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal isn't minimalism for its own sake. It's clarity. When you
        remove the unnecessary, what remains speaks louder.
