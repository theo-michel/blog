        <h1>Silence</h1>
        <time class="date">November 2025</time>
        
        <p>Silence is not empty. It's full of answers.</p>
        
        <p>We fill every gap with noise—music, podcasts, notifications. As if silence were something to be avoided. But silence is where thoughts complete themselves.</p>
        
        <p>In conversation, the pause is where understanding lives. In music, the rest gives the note its meaning. In design, the whitespace lets the eye breathe.</p>
        
        <p>What you don't say matters as much as what you do.</p>
