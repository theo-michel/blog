        <h1>The Weight of Less</h1>
        <time class="date">December 2025</time>
        
        <p>Every object you own has weight. Not just physical weight—mental weight. It occupies space in your mind, demands maintenance, creates decisions.</p>
        
        <p>I used to think more options meant more freedom. But options are obligations in disguise. Each one asks: choose me, organize me, remember me.</p>
        
        <p>There's a lightness that comes from having exactly what you need. Not less than you need—that's deprivation. Exactly what you need. That's freedom.</p>
        
        <p>The things you keep should earn their place.</p>
